          <h1>Adrien Houédé</h1>
          <h2>Game designer & developer full stack</h2>
          <p>
            From a very young age, I have always evolved in an IT environment, 
            whether with my father who is a developer or with my older brother who work in network. So I naturally developed a interest for 
            coding, starting with games then developpement web and more recently a backend specialization.

            I did an internship as a fullstack developer for 3 months at Celuga. 
            I had the opportunity to learn the Bootstrap framework on the front end and the .Net framework in C# on the back end.

            I had the opportunity to independently develop the back office of a site which allowed us to reward our client's employees. 
            I had to develop my database, create the tool interface, but also develop the system for drawing lots and notifying the various stakeholders.

          </p>
          <p>
            I developed this game during my first year of BUT, as part of a school project. Entirely developed in javascript, 
            with a free sprite sheet found on the internet, the map coming from the platform game Ultimate Chicken Horse 
            and modified by myself to add the platforms.
          </p>
          <p>
            The notable points are the handling of collisions, the animation of the sprite sheet, the creation of gravity, 
            the implementation of the jump and the detection of the success of the player to change the map.
          </p>
          <p>
            The faults of this game are the lack of a welcome menu and a point counter, the absence of a defeat detection which 
            forces the user to reload the page, the non-playability on mobile and obviously non-original graphics and 
            not free of rights which create copyright problems if it was not a school project.

            <b>If you want to play I invite you to click on the image.</b>
            The game is on the website Replit, you just have to create a account and run the code.
          </p>
          <p>
            This game was for me my very first development during my last year of high school. It is also in a school setting 
            that I realized it but with a friend who took care of the graphics. It is a development from scratch without 
            a separate library for the graphics part.
          </p>
          <p>
            The technical part of the game works and the graphics part is finished, 
            unfortunately the linking of the two generates bugs that we have not had the time to correct.
          </p>
          <p>
            As far as the technical part is concerned, the game takes place in a double-entry table, a matrix, 
            with a scan after each turn of the players, which detects the presence or not of paterns of pawns defined 
            to trigger their destruction then a fall of the pawns above and a random regeneration of the pawns.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for the faults, we find the absence of graphics, no victory or defeat system or even an objective to make 
            you want to play and finally the presence of a single square card and no other game mechanics that 
            would add depth to the gameplay.

          <h1>Web documentary on concerts in virtual reality</h1>

          </p>
          <p>
            I made this web documentary in a group at the beginning of my second year of my BUT. 
            It was very rewarding on different aspects, whether it was making contact with professionals, 
            conducting interviews, writing the webdoc, whether it was the article or the voiceovers, 
            and finally creating a simple website. and operational in just one working day.
          </p>
          <p>
            The website is developed only in html and css, it has two pages, with the idea of welcoming users on the first page, 
            installing a VR headset for them and then launching the webdoc with the button as if entering a world in VR.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for the content, I let you discover it for yourself, and for the faults I will not mention them because 
            during this project, the development part did not count, so I favored a functional and bug-free website. 
            In addition, it is also unfortunately not responsive.
